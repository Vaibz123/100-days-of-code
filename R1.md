Day 6: August 10, Monday

Progress: Extracted single values from web table

Feelings: It was a herculean task finding ids of table elements. Requires a lot of patience.

Day 7: August 11, Tuesday

Progress: Extracted all data from webtable of 747 rows. Code was small but the effort put in extracting data was huge.

Feelings: Didn't like it much as I had to execute the same code n times as all data can't be extracted at one go.

Day 8: August 14, Friday

Progress: Did the classification of tweets using Logistic regression

Thoughts: I missed the last 2 days consecutively which is against the rules. Will try to cover for that by not missing a day in next 21 days

Day 9: August 15, Saturday

Progress: Learnt doing face detection using Python. A very simple thing to do all because of opencv.

Feelings: Have become a bit lazy these days. Getting on track after taking a break in between is not an easy thing to do.

Day 10: August 16, Sunday

Progress: Learnt Naive Bayes and implemented  classification of tweets using Naive Bayes

Thoughts: Was stuck on it in the middle because of a silly mistake

Day 11: August 17, Monday

Progress: Learnt PCA and use of Vector Space Models

Thoughts: Didn't implement anything today as I was busy with some other work. Hope this never repeats again.

Day 12: August 18, Tuesday 

Progress: Started implementing PCA on word vectors

Feelings: I am going a little slow nowadays. Needs to pick up my speed.

Day 13: August 19, Wednesday

Progress: Completed implementing PCA  algorithm on word vectors to find a group of similar words

Feelings: Performing PCA for visualizing data was fun to do.
