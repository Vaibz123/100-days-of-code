Day 1: August 5,2020

Today's Progress: Created an editable magic square of order 5 with 2 buttons below.
		  Used Flexbox for first time and explored it a bit
		  
Thoughts: It was a good experience working with Flexbox

Day 3: August 7, 2020

Today's Progress: Completed backend/logic part of Magic Square (generating random magic square of order 5 by using function random of python )

Thoughts: Feels good to have completed this at much lesser time than expected.

Day 5: August 9, 2020

Today's Progress: Completed Login automation of website

Thoughts: Making use of code to automate day to day activities felt great

Link to work: [Automation-Table data Extraction](https://github.com/Vaibz123/Webtable-data-extraction/commit/a37301a34718a31f181f7df8a191bf82c1089f63)

Day 6: August 10, 2020

Progress: Extracted single values from web table

Feelings: It was a herculean task finding ids of table elements. Requires a lot of patience.

Day 7: August 11, 2020 

Progress: Extracted all data from webtable of 747 rows. Code was small but the effort put in extracting data was huge.

Feelings: Didn't like it much as I had to execute the same code n times as all data can't be extracted at one go.

Day 8: August 14, 2020

Progress: Did the classification of tweets using Logistic regression

Thoughts: I missed the last 2 days consecutively which is against the rules. Will try to cover for that by not missing a day in next 21 days

Day 9: August 15, 2020

Progress: Learnt doing face detection using Python. A very simple thing to do all because of opencv.

Feelings: Have become a bit lazy these days. Getting on track after taking a break in between is not an easy thing to do.

Day 10: August 16, 2020

Progress: Learnt Naive Bayes and implemented  classification of tweets using Naive Bayes

Thoughts: Was stuck on it in the middle because of a silly mistake

Day 11: August 17, 2020

Progress: Learnt PCA and use of Vector Space Models

Thoughts: Didn't implement anything today as I was busy with some other work. Hope this never repeats again.

Day 12: August 18, 2020 

Progress: Started implementing PCA on word vectors

Feelings: I am going a little slow nowadays.Needs to pick up my speed.

Day 13: August 19,2020

Progress: Completed implementing PCA  algorithm on word vectors to find a group of similar words

Feelings: Performing PCA for visualizing data was fun to do.

Day 14: August 20,2020

Progress: Started learning CSS for drawing pictures/images

Feelings:  Just explored CSS and didn't do much today

Day 15: August 21,2020

Progress: Designed my first basic and simple image using CSS-Android logo.

Feelings: It was easy and fun to do.
